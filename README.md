# Fast Facts Client

## Local Usage

To run locally, simply clone the repo and run ```npm i``` then ```npm run start```.
The client is already connected to a remotely deployed server. 
A modifiable version can be found [here](https://github.com/ailsamm/moodi-server) (simply clone, run ```npm i``` and then, in this client app, change the URL in the ./src/config.js) or work with the already-deployed version that is specified in ./src/config.js.

## Live Version
A live version of the app (connected to a deployed server) can be found [here](https://fast-facts.vercel.app/).
